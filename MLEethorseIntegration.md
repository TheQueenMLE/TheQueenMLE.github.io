# MLE Ethorse Ecosystem Integration

> We are excited to be working closer with the Ethorse team as we work to extend the MLE dAPP and drive community involvement and volume on the original Ethorse platform.  That being said, it is important that we share this document which presents a high level overview of the project's status along with some of our goals as a team.  
> We will start by overviewing the main features of the platform.  We will then follow up with our current plan for monetization and close the document by proposing some thoughts about the future of this project.

## | Main Features and Flexibility

We are open to change the design and/or implement more Ethorse related visuals.  However, it is important to mention that we cannot change the horsey 3D visuals (models/artstyle), as that would change the nature of the universe too much.
However, sharing components for visualization is trivial. If the interest is mutual, we hope to create a react/redux shared component library with the dev team.

#### Below are the main three features we offer:

1. Race Viewer: 3D viewer showing Ethorse races in real-time
2. Racing Collectibles: ERC-721 tokens generated and awarded to participant victors.
3. Racing Statistics: Varying stats about different players, races and coin performance.


#### What we are working on right now:

- Realtime Statistics with our own MLEbridge Server.
- Translation into mandarin, german, russian, french and other languages
- Getting ready for beta and token claiming for mainnet
- Removing dependency upon Metamask for most of the dAPP's features

#### Some of the features we have explored and hope to implement in the future include:

- Mobile support for race viewer and stats
- Circuit Type Race Tracks
- Jockey Betting/Fund Management System: Players can place forward their bets and trust on other players.  This will allow “passive betting” as a user.  Davoice has voiced interest in such a role.
(We experimented with an ‘ethorse Derivative’ Smart contract designed to allow users to trade generic  “betting tokens” based on a actual ethorse bet during the race. This could be used to manage funds for multiple users and more)
- Decentraland ethorse VR Experience and ethorse-related funhouse

## || Current Monetization Plan

Our current plan for monetization is to take donations.  However, we plan to have a number of different routes to profit.  These options are listed below:

- Donations:  Allow players and community members to send ETH to our donation contract. More info and video: https://thequeenmle.github.io/about.html
- HRSY Fee: Charge a small fee for claiming HRSY tokens ie. .008 ETH
- Renaming HRSY: Charge small fee to give a HRSY token a custom name (paid per character as a vanity feature)

Because monetization is currently the main challenge for our project, we would love some insight from the Ethorse team here.  Our team just started paying for servers for the project and up until recently we have operated without them - and all funds needed for the project came from our personal cryptocurrency funds.  Our entire team would love to commit more time and invest in additional resources to bring the project to the next level.  We are open to various changes and suggestions to help make this happen.  For example, we think it may be interesting to find ways to incorporate the HORSE token into the platform.  Unlocking this utility, may in turn help propel the value of the token in interesting ways. This will require a signature system built for Betting smart contract to ensure that only official races can be used for claiming tokens.


## ||| Future Goals and Thoughts
In the future, we plan to add additional games and ways for players to spend more time interacting with the dAPP.  The end vision is an Ethorse themed funhouse in decentraland with races and meta-games.  We would be very interested in discussing the possibility of integrating the HORSE token into this funhouse. The new status of MLE should provide more traction and more volume to Ethorse. However, our resources are limited as of now, since we don't have funds nor a solid business model to support our partnership. We're hoping that this endorsement will encourage you to help point us in the right direction to seek out some funding and keep the project moving forward.
